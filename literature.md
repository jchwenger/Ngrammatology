## Modernism 

A trio of titans from the modernist era;

Notice, however, that this was in the English-speaking world. In France, the same looks like this:

To my surprise, Virginia Woolf has grown recently, and comes on top (English-speaking world again):

Although once again, seen from France, Marcel is still *way* ahead.

One could see a similar phenomenon as with Woolf, just starker, when injecting Colette into the mix:

## Ladies' wars

Taking some big women writers from the English-speaking sphere. Notice once again the remarkable presence of Woolf, as well as the Austen rebound in the late 20<sup>th</sup> century.

## A shot at the German-speaking world

Just some big names coming to mind. Notice the difference of importance between the German corpus (first graph), and the English one (second).

<iframe name="ngram_chart" src="https://books.google.com/ngrams/interactive_chart?content=Thomas+Mann%2C+Franz+Kafka%2CRainer+Maria+Rilke%2CHeinrich+Heine%2CRobert+Musil&year_start=1800&year_end=2000&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2CThomas%20Mann%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CFranz%20Kafka%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CRainer%20Maria%20Rilke%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CHeinrich%20Heine%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CRobert%20Musil%3B%2Cc0" width=900 height=400 marginwidth=0 marginheight=0 hspace=0 vspace=0 frameborder=0 scrolling=no></iframe>

Obviously everything would change if you only put the last name (e.g. 'Kafka' instead of 'Franz Kafka') in the same corpora, but the tool, to my knowledge, only searches for words, not entities, hence the idea that a much more common name like 'Mann' (already a few writers, Thomas, Heinrich, etc.) would pop up way more often than others...

To put things into perspective, let's shove the big Weimar classics in:

<iframe name="ngram_chart" src="https://books.google.com/ngrams/interactive_chart?content=Goethe%2CH%C3%B6lderlin%2CSchiller%2C+Thomas+Mann&year_start=1800&year_end=2000&corpus=20&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2CGoethe%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CH%C3%B6lderlin%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CSchiller%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CThomas%20Mann%3B%2Cc0" width=900 height=400 marginwidth=0 marginheight=0 hspace=0 vspace=0 frameborder=0 scrolling=no></iframe>

Once again if you are strict and only have full names, you don't get the same picture. But given that it's been ages since writers refer to Goethe as Goethe, or Hölderlin as Hölderlin, it is no wonder that the full names yield less results (same problem as above: there are quite a few Schillers or Mann around, we'd need true entity recognition here!).

## All-times giants

Because I just can't resist (yes, included the big philosophers as well)...
